FizzBuzz Problem Statement

Based on a traditional English children's game
Print the numbers 1..100
For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
For multiples of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number
Here: fill an array instead of printing + some other complications
